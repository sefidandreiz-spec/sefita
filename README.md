<h1 align="center">Rare Disease, Real Kid: MVA Hackathon 2026 - Dataset</h1>


* **Challenge Space:** [SageBio/rare-disease-real-kid-mva-hackathon-2026](https://sagebio-rare-disease-real-kid-mva-hackathon-2026.hf.space/)
* **Submission Period:** 24 August 2026 – 24 October 2026
* **Dataset Size:** ~85 GB

---

## Quickstart

* ### Python

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

# Download a specific file into a local './data' folder
file_path = hf_hub_download(
    repo_id="SageBio/mva-hackathon-2026-data",
    filename="WGS_EX2312012_HGWCNDSX7.vcf.gz",  # Replace with target file
    repo_type="dataset",
    local_dir="./data",
    token="YOUR_HF_TOKEN"
)

print(f"File downloaded to: {file_path}")
```

* ### CLI

```bash
# Download a specific file into a local './data' folder
hf download SageBio/mva-hackathon-2026-data \
  WGS_EX2312012_HGWCNDSX7.vcf.gz \
  --repo-type dataset \
  --local-dir ./data \
  --token YOUR_HF_TOKEN
```

**Note:** `YOUR_HF_TOKEN` can be omitted from either approach if you've previously logged in (either via
`hf auth login` or by setting the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable).

## Full Data Download

The compressed dataset is ~85 GB across 11 files. We strongly recommend having at least 100 - 150 GB
of storage to account for file caching, indexing, and pipeline intermediate files.

* ### Python

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

# Download challenge files into a local './data' folder
dataset_dir = snapshot_download(
    repo_id="SageBio/mva-hackathon-2026-data",
    repo_type="dataset",
    local_dir="./data",
    ignore_patterns=["README.md", ".gitattributes"],
    token="YOUR_HF_TOKEN"
)

print(f"Dataset downloaded to: {dataset_dir}")
```

* ### CLI

```bash
# Download challenge files into a local './data' folder
hf download \
  SageBio/mva-hackathon-2026-data \
  --repo-type dataset \
  --local-dir ./data \
  --exclude "README.md" ".gitattributes" \
  --token YOUR_HF_TOKEN
```
